- the model is working only for the 2D images
- them del returns 2 matrix i.e. kr, box
    - kr is 2 coordinates each for 21 landmarks
    - box is the box coordinates containing hand
- The inference time is about 500ms for images of 640x640
- the output is a little off after image resizing
- we do not need the box for our model.
